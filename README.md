# Framingham Heart Study: Predicting Cardiovascular Disease Risk

## Overview
As a passionate student of life sciences, I undertook this project to explore the fascinating realm of cardiovascular disease prediction using machine learning techniques. The Framingham Heart Study dataset provided a rich source of information, allowing me to delve into the intricate relationships between various risk factors and the development of coronary heart disease (CHD).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Framingham Heart Study Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/amanajmera1/framingham-heart-study-dataset). It contains information on various demographic, behavioral, and medical attributes that may influence the risk of developing CHD within a 10-year period.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Before diving into the modeling phase, I conducted a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. This process involved cleaning and preprocessing the data, handling missing values, and visualizing the relationships between different variables using libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.

## Modeling Techniques
To predict the risk of 10-year CHD, I employed several powerful machine learning algorithms, including:

1. **Decision Trees**: These tree-based models allowed me to capture complex decision boundaries and hierarchical relationships between features, providing interpretable results.

2. **Logistic Regression**: As a fundamental classification algorithm, logistic regression offered a probabilistic approach to modeling the relationship between risk factors and the likelihood of developing CHD.

3. **Random Forest Classifiers**: By combining multiple decision trees, random forests provided robust predictions and mitigated the risk of overfitting, leveraging the strengths of ensemble learning.

## Project Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python (version 3.x)
- Required Python modules:
 - numpy
 - seaborn
 - pandas
 - matplotlib
 - scikit-learn

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your needs. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
